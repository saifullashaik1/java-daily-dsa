# Array:

* In Java, an array is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in a contiguous memory location.
* Arrays are useful for storing multiple values in a single variable and can be used with both primitive data types (e.g., int, char, float) and reference types (e.g., String, objects).
* Declaring and Initializing Arrays:
  1.Declaration: An array must first be declared, specifying its data type.
  2.Instantiation: The array is then instantiated using the new keyword.
  3.Initialization: Finally, the array can be initialized with values.

## Multidimensional Arrays :
* Java allows the creation of arrays with more than one dimension, such as 2D arrays (arrays of arrays).

## Limitations of Arrays:
* Fixed Size: The size of an array is fixed at the time of creation, so you cannot resize it dynamically.
* Homogeneous Data: Arrays can only store elements of the same type.
* Limited Built-in Functions: Compared to collections (like ArrayList), arrays have fewer utility methods.
