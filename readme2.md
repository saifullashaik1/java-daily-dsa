## Array.

* In Java, an array is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in a contiguous memory location.
* Arrays are useful for storing multiple values in a single variable and can be used with both primitive data types (e.g., int, char, float) and reference types (e.g., String, objects).
* Declaring and Initializing Arrays:
  1.Declaration: An array must first be declared, specifying its data type.
  2.Instantiation: The array is then instantiated using the new keyword.
  3.Initialization: Finally, the array can be initialized with values.

example:
// Declaring an array of integers
int[] numbers = new int[5];  // Array size is 5

// Initializing values
numbers[0] = 10;
numbers[1] = 20;
numbers[2] = 30;
numbers[3] = 40;
numbers[4] = 50;
